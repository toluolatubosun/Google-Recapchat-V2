# Google Re-Captcha Demo

This is a simple demo of Google Re-Captcha. The frontend has a simple form built with Next.js and the backend is built with Express.js. The backend has a registration endpoint that uses Google Re-Captcha to verify the user is not a bot.

This makes use of the invisible Google Re-Captcha V2
